## Known Limitations

- **Estimates Only**: Bandwidth calculations are estimates based on canvas analysis, not actual build measurements
- **No Video Analysis**: Video files are not currently detected or analyzed
- **No Third-Party Scripts**: External scripts and fonts loaded outside Framer are not measured
- **Canvas-Based**: Analysis is based on the Framer canvas, not the published site (unless using published mode)

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Won't Load
- Ensure you're using Framer Desktop app (not web)
- Check that the dev server is running on port 5173
- Try restarting Framer

### Analysis Shows No Assets
- Verify you have images or SVGs in your project
- Check that assets are on actual pages (not just design pages)
- Try refreshing the analysis

### Recommendations Not Appearing
- Ensure you have large images (>200KB) or unoptimized formats
- Check that images are not already in WebP/AVIF format
- Verify images are not on excluded design pages
